          <h2>Physical Properties</h2>
          <p>
            Jade, especially jadeite, is renowned for its smooth, glassy luster and vibrant range of colors—most notably the deep greens highly prized in Asia. Jadeite typically rates between 6.5 and 7 on the Mohs scale, and its toughness is enhanced by an interlocking crystal structure. The gemstone’s translucency and fine texture allow for a natural polish that brings out its subtle hues. While green is the most valued, jade is also found in white, lavender, orange, and even black variants. Its unique combination of hardness and toughness makes it ideal for both jewelry and intricate carvings. The even, granular texture of jade contributes to its distinctive, almost wax-like appearance. Modern cutting techniques have been developed to preserve as much of the stone’s natural integrity as possible. Detailed microscopic inspections ensure that natural inclusions are appreciated as marks of authenticity. Jade’s ability to take on a high polish sets it apart from many other gemstones. Its inherent beauty and durability have made it a favorite material for both functional art and ornamental pieces.
